# 🏆 CardMatchAI - Personalized Credit Card Recommendations

> **🏆 Won Second Place at Capital One Tech Summit Hackathon!**

CardMatchAI is a personalized credit card recommendation app that solves the overwhelming process of choosing a credit card. Our solution addresses a problem many of us face by providing intelligent, personalized recommendations based on lifestyle and financial goals.

**🌐 Live Demo: [https://cardmatchai.info/](https://cardmatchai.info/)**

## 🎯 Project Overview

CardMatchAI provides personalized recommendations for Credit Cards based on lifestyle and goals. We built it with React, FastAPI, and a **parallel multi-agent LLM system** using LangGraph to filter over **Real Credit Cards from 15 trusted issuers** to find the perfect match.

### 🏅 Hackathon Achievement

I'm incredibly proud to announce that my team and I won **Second Place** in the hackathon at the Capital One Tech Summit Program! 

In this **Selective 5% Acceptance Rate Program**, we were also taught first-hand by Capital One Engineers on React, API Testing design with Express.js & other valuable skills!

**Team Members:**
- Nithin Kosanam
- Rocklyn Clarke IV 
- Esther Adedipe
- Yamilette Alemañy Vázquez

A huge thank you to all of the Capital One Engineers for your Lessons, the Hackathon Judges, Terris Johnson for the Recruitment into this program, David Cook for the Hackathon Mentorship & Amrutha Obbineni for Managing the program these past 5 days!

## 🚀 Key Innovation: Parallel Multi-Agent Architecture

### The Challenge
Instead of using a single, expensive GPT-4o Turbo Model to analyze all 80+ Credit Cards that significantly increased loading time.

### The Solution
I designed a **parallel multi-agent architecture** using Python's ThreadPoolExecutor & LangGraph that splits the 80 Credit Card Database across **3 specialized sub-agents running simultaneously**.

### Results
- **66% reduction in loading time**
- **Intelligent filtering** across 80+ credit cards
- **Perfect matches** based on user profiles
- **Scalable architecture** for future expansion

## 🎯 Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Multi-Agent System
- **Question Asker Agent** - Gathers user preferences through conversation
- **Analysis Agent** - Processes user profile and matches cards
- **Recommendation Agent** - Provides personalized card suggestions

### 💳 Comprehensive Card Database
- **80+ Credit Cards** from 15 trusted issuers
- **Real-time data** with up-to-date information
- **Multiple categories**: Travel, Cash Back, Student, Business, Secured

### 🎨 Personalized Recommendations
- **Lifestyle-based matching** (travel frequency, spending habits)
- **Credit score optimization** (excellent, good, fair, poor)
- **Goal-oriented suggestions** (travel rewards, cash back, credit building)
- **Income and spending analysis**

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel processing** with ThreadPoolExecutor
- **66% faster loading** compared to single-agent approach
- **Intelligent caching** for repeated queries
- **Efficient database queries**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Hackathon_Cap_One
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env_example.txt .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
   ```

4. **Run the backend server**
   ```bash
   python api_server.py
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**
   ```bash
   # Open frontend/index.html in your browser
   # Or serve it with a local server
   ```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /` - API information and available endpoints
- `POST /start` - Start a new conversation
- `POST /chat` - Send messages to the agent
- `POST /submit-profile` - Submit complete profile for recommendations
- `GET /status/{session_id}` - Get conversation status

### Example Usage
```bash
# Start a conversation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/start"

# Send a message
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I want a travel rewards card", "session_id": "your-session-id"}'
```

## 🎯 Multi-Agent Architecture Details

### Agent Specialization
1. **Question Asker Node** - Manages conversation flow and profile gathering
2. **Final Analysis Node** - Processes complete profiles and generates recommendations
3. **Tool Integration** - Provides specialized functions for card filtering and analysis

### Parallel Processing
```python
# Example of parallel agent execution
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    futures = [
        executor.submit(agent1.analyze_cards, user_profile),
        executor.submit(agent2.filter_by_credit_score, user_profile),
        executor.submit(agent3.calculate_rewards, user_profile)
    ]
    results = [future.result() for future in futures]
```
